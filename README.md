# Sailing Twin

## About
Sailing Twin is an application to track and visualize regattas. The boats are tracked through a phone application and are displayed on a web application. The web application is a 3D realistic simulation of the regatta according to the data collected by the app and the meteo-oceanographic conditions.

## Mission
Spectating sailing and regattas presents a challenge, as observing these events from land can be quite challenging. Current solutions typically provide only a live 2D map of the regatta, leaving spectators with limited viewing options. Sailing Twin creates a realistic 3D simulation accessible to all.
